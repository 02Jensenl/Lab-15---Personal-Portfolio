<h1>What about me!?</h1>


<body>
    
    <p>I previuously worked in manufacturing, both on the labor side and office (inside sales/customer service) side of things. With not exactly enjoying my position, I decided something needed to change.
        My previous employer was switching to a new ERP/SAP software and it used computer coding to make it function and customize it to each departments' needs. 
        Unfortunately, the person in charge of this softwre project left the company and we were left with only who person who had limited coding experience. 
        I thought, "Hey, maybe I should look into that to try and help! I like computers and maybe this could kickstart a new career change and passion!" 
        Fast forward to today, and here I am working on becoming a software developer.</p>
    
    <h3>What do I want to do after Bootamp?</h3>
    <p>Great question! I am still figuring that out. Overall, I want to help people (or clients) create and/or maintain software. While that is pretty broad statement, I think working in QA or cyber security would be interesting.
        Who knows?! I'm just seeking a career that will keep me engaged with continous learning, help me become an amazing software developer, and be a part of a company that I'm proud to work for</p>
